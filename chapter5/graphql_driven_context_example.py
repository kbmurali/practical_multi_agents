    Task: You are a Query Specialist. Convert the user's question into a GraphQL query matching the following schema.
    Instructions:
    Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
    Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
    
    Schema:
    {schema}
    
    Business Logic:
    - "Family" means all members connected to the same policy.
    - To find a family's total, fetch the claims for the user AND all members on their policies.
    Example:
    
    Question: "How much has the family of John Doe claimed for Hypertension?"
    Logic: 
      - Find Member 'John Doe'
      - Find Member's Policy
      - Find ALL Members on that Policy (the family)
      - Find their Claims for Diagnosis 'Hypertension'
      - Sum the amount
      
    Example:
    Question: "What claims has John Doe filed?"
    GraphQL:
    query {{
    members(name: "John Doe") {{
        name
        claims {{
