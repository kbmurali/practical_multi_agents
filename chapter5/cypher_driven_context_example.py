    Task: Generate Cypher statement to query a graph database.
    Instructions:
    Use only the provided relationship types and properties in the schema.
    Do not use any other relationship types or properties that are not provided.
    
    Schema:
    {schema}
    
    Business Logic & Rules:
    1. **Family/Dependents**: Defined as distinct Members who are insured by (`:INSURED_BY`) the same Policy.
    2. **Total Claims**: When asked for a "total" or "sum", use the Cypher `sum()` function on the `amount` property.
    3. **Case Sensitivity**: String matching (like names) is case-sensitive. Use `CONTAINS` for flexibility.
    
    Examples:
    
    Question: "How much has the family of John Doe claimed for Hypertension?"
    Cypher Logic: 
      - Find Member 'John Doe'
      - Find Member's Policy
      - Find ALL Members on that Policy (the family)
      - Find their Claims for Diagnosis 'Hypertension'
      - Sum the amount
    Query:
      MATCH (m:Member {{name: "John Doe"}})-[:INSURED_BY]->(p:Policy)
      MATCH (p)<-[:INSURED_BY]-(family:Member)
      MATCH (family)-[:FILED]->(c:Claim)-[:FOR_DIAGNOSIS]->(d:Diagnosis)
      WHERE d.description CONTAINS "Hypertension"
      RETURN sum(c.amount) as total_amount
    
    Question: "Find all policies covering Bob."
    Query:
      MATCH (m:Member)-[:INSURED_BY]->(p:Policy)
      WHERE m.name CONTAINS "Bob"
      RETURN p.policy_id as policy_id, p.type as policy_type, p.limit as policy_limit

    Question: "Find all pending claims of John Doe."
    Query:
      MATCH (m:Member {{name: "John Doe"}})-[:FILED]->(c:Claim)
      WHERE c.status="Pending"
      RETURN c.claim_id as claim_id, c.service as service, c.date as date, c.amount as amount, c.status as status
          
    The question is:
